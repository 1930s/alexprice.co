        <h2>Apple Watch + iPhone Stand</h2>
        <span>Hey! Okay, so I'll keep the talking to a minimum, and the pictures to a max. I started working on this about a week and a half ago - I knew that I wanted to build something for Father's Day, rather than do a card or something. I started out on Pinterest, looking at a ton of different stuff that people had made for "Dad". <br><br>

        I wasn't a huge fan.<br><br>

        <div class="h-center">
            <a href="../media/fathersday/pinterest.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/pinterest.jpg" class="square"></a>
        </div><br><br>

        So I shifted gears a little, going more for a jobs-to-be-done approach, and thinking about something that could be useful to you. I was thinking something that wasn't consumable, so that it could last a while, while still providing a lasting and quality purpose. I remembered talking a little bit about stands for the Watch and phone, and thought that I might try and <i>make</i> a stand.<br><br><br>

        <div class="h-center">
            <a href="../media/fathersday/sketch1.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/sketch1.jpg" class="square"></a>
            <a href="../media/fathersday/sketch2.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/sketch2.jpg" class="square"></a>
            <a href="../media/fathersday/sketch3.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/sketch3.jpg" class="square"></a>
        </div><br><br>

        Those are a few of my initial sketches - I knew that I wanted the watch to be able to rest on its side, to support the new nightstand mode, and I knew I wanted a spot for your phone as well. I thought that it would be best if the phone was facing you, rather than flat, so that you could see the screen.<br><br>

        When I'm home, lying in bed, and going to sleep, I love to use Siri to set an alarm - when your phone is plugged in, you can say "Hey Siri", and Siri will pop up and take commands. It's a pain that I can't see the screen when I do that. #firstworldproblems<br><br>

        Okay, so I knew I wanted a standing phone, and a horizontal watch. Both would need some sort of stable, somewhat soft surface - I thought that cork would work out well here. It's relatively cheap, easy to install (as opposed to leather, or some sort of cloth), does the job, and looks nice.<br><br><br>

        <div class="h-center">
            <a href="../media/fathersday/cork.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/cork.jpg" class="square"></a>
        </div><br><br>

        Okay - so I've got a concept, a rest material, and at this point some dimensions for the space required. I think it should go without saying that I'd need some channels for cables, channels that I wanted hidden. You can kind of see that in the sketches above. <br><br>

        At this point, I needed a material for the piece itself. I went to this lumber place about 20 or 30 minutes from home, getting there meant taking a few sketchy streets, and passing through some really sketchy areas, but the place itself was nice, and well run. I went through the lumber that they had (it was kind of a warehouse of wood), and felt that walnut filled the most criteria - it was solid, felt substantial, and was of good quality. I'm hoping that the color really comes out once it's stained, it looks a little faded in this photo.<br><br><br>

        <div class="h-center">
            <a href="../media/fathersday/wood.jpg"><img src="../media/fathersday/wood.jpg" class="square"></a>
        </div><br><br>

        So that's where I'm at right now. I've been talking with Sperry to get some of the parts made, and I'm going into the shop in the coming week to laser cut and machine the stand. <br><br>

        Sorry it wasn't ready by Father's Day - the project took more time and effort than I had expected. :)
