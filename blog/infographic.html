        <h2>Designing with data</h2>
        <span>I began the project with a log file about a thousand pages long, a word document with some project goals, and a few emails with the client. I knew it was going to be fun. My task was to take the goals in that word doc, and design a one-page infographic displaying the information in the log file. <br><br>
            
            The data in that log file was... dense. Insurance market information can only be so interesting, and to display it in a way that would keep people's eyes open meant that I needed some creative visuals. The project taught me a ton about dealing with data in a meaningful way, and representing that data such that people understood it's value quickly. <br><br>
        
        There's plenty of icons and visual information on the web that can sometimes be difficult to parse - things like hamburger menus and cryptic little svg's are meant to communicate without words, and oftentimes that just doesn't work out. I was forced to think a little more deeply about data representation because of the type of information and real estate, an experience that I think will be seriously useful moving forward into further design and web projects.<br><br>
        
        Design is about communication. Communication, through words, images, logos, icons, films, animations, audio, and a plethora of other mediums is sometimes difficult to grapple with to produce a meaningful result. Thinking deeply about the business needs of a client is what helped me to best understand the how of this project.</span> <br><br>
