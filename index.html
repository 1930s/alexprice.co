	<h1>Process</h1>

	<ol>
		<li><h3>We’ll see if I’m a good fit</h3></li>
		<div class="body-copy">I have a skillset that’s good for some products,
			and not so good for others. The first discussion I’ll have with you
			is to see whether or not we’d be able to successfully build
			something. Better to figure that out early on, then after a ton of
			time and money has been spent.</div>

		<li><h3>Define business objectives</h3></li>
		<div class="body-copy">I’m an economics major, and I’ve run a business
			before. I’m here to help you achieve business objectives. We’ll
			figure out what those objectives are, and use that to define product
			strategy.</div>

		<li><h3>Iterate, iterate, iterate</h3></li>
		<div class="body-copy">We’ll have a few rounds of sketch, mockup,
			prototype, repeat. I’ve found that the best version of a product
			isn’t the first one - iterating on ideas quickly will help us
			uncover the best way to achieve your business goals.</div>

		<li><h3>Ship, and evaluate</h3></li>
		<div class="body-copy">After we’ve defined what the product looks like,
			I’ll move fast to build it—then build it again. After we’ve shipped
			your project, I’m not quite finished yet—I’ll help you determine
			whether or not the product has achieved pre-set goals, and make
			data-driven tweaks to get as close to success as possible.</div>
