# Alex Price & Co.

_This is my personal site. I use it as an online business card, showcase, and thesis statement._

I build websites, <a href="http://geshergroup.org">teams,</a>
<a href="http://formulaslug.com">electric racecars</a>,
<a href="http://vchainsolutions.com">edtech software</a>, and a few other things.

I grew up in Austin TX, and moved to Santa Cruz CA for university. I currently
work at VChain Solutions, building supply chain education software, but am open
to new clients. Iâ€™m looking for work with bots (read: ai), or transportation
tech, in an engineering or design role.

Reach out to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/alexpriceco">Twitter</a>, or on
<a href="http://alexprice.co">my website</a>. I'd love to get coffee or lunch,
and talk about robots, space, design, or transportation.
