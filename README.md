# Alex Price & Co.

_This is my personal site. I use it as an online business card, showcase, and thesis statement._

I'm Alex Price: a student, product designer, and front-end developer. I eat a ton of carrots, read daily, love the sound of jazz and rain, and wear black oxford shirts with blue jeans. I collaborate with inspiring clientsâ€”we produce high-quality products to solve business objectives, and enjoy the process.
I grew up in Austin TX, and moved to Santa Cruz CA, to study economics and computer science. I currently work at <a href="vchainsolutions.com">VChain Solutions</a>, building supply chain education software, but am open to new clients.

Want to work together, grab lunch, or hop on a Skype call? Email me at <a href="mailto:alex@alexprice.co">alex@alexprice.co</a>.
